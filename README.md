# This is a compilation of all the notes/projects that are currently being taken 1/6/2021 - present while I work through the above book:

On 1/12/2021 I decided that I would be taking notes in varies ways about Python from the above book and from the website programiz.com
programiz.com has been another tool that I have been using to understand Python

My initial impressions of the Park book is that it was not edited . . . at all. I have found multiple problems with its python code in very basic examples
that would get a beginner confused.

I decided to get this book as a supplimental tool while going through my primary text, Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way, which is excellent, albeit confusing at times
due to the purposeful lack of explanation.
